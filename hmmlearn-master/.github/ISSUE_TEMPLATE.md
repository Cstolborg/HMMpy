## I am requesting a new feature

This library is currently not under active development.  Large-scale features
are unlikely to be added unless accompanied with a PR, which will be considered
by the maintainers to the best of their ability.

## I am reporting a bug

If you are reporting a bug, please

- Make sure that it occurs with the latest release of hmmlearn (per
  https://pypi.org/project/hmmlearn/).
- Provide a short, self-contained, correct example (http://sscce.org/).
  Maintainers must be able to reproduce the issue **by copy-pasting your
  example in a new, empty file/console/notebook**.  Avoid including data files
  as much as possible; if they are absolutely necessary, they must be in csv or
  npy format, and code for loading the file must be included in the example.

Issues not reproducible with the latest release of hmmlearn or without a short,
self-contained, correct example **will be closed**.
