API Documentation
=================

This is the documentation of ``hmmpy``. It consists of 3 general classes for estimation and one class used for sampling. They are  structured as follows:

* hmmpy.base.BaseHiddenMarkov: This class holds all the base methods shared across estimation methods. This includes methods related to an HMM that is already fitted (such as sampling), initialization methods etc.
* hmmpy.mle.MLEHMM: Methods related to maximum likeleihood estimation using Expectation Maximizing (Baum-Welch) algorithm.
* hmmpy.jump.JumpHMM: Methods related to jump estimation.
