\section{Regime Based Asset Allocation}
Portfolio allocation boils down to essentially maximizing the return generated for a given amount of risk. The portfolio manager who successfully and consistently does so, will have more money to manage and more satisfied investors. Generally speaking there are three approaches when it comes to portfolio selection that sophisticated institutional investors utilize (Nystrup, 2017). The first approach consists of diversification, which entails increasing risk-adjusted returns by forming optimal portfolios on the basis of allocating capital towards imperfectly correlated assets. This is also known as static asset allocation, since the portfolio allocation is constructed to capitalize on bullish market periods while providing protection in market periods, hence static asset allocation is considered an all-weather portfolio.
