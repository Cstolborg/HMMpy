\section{TODO across all sections}


\textbf{List of must haves before hand-in:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Test different features for jump estimator - see e.g. Henning
    \item Rewrite log-scaling section with pseudo-code for entire HMM estimation - as in the paper tutorial.
    \item Stylized facts session - VERY IMPORTANT TO GET DONE!
    \item Add plots for MPC portfolio performance and draw frontiers
    \item Compute performance of alternative portoflios such as 1/n and static all-weather portfolios - add to comparison.
\end{itemize}



\textbf{List of nice to have before hand in:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Train MLE with T-distribution.
